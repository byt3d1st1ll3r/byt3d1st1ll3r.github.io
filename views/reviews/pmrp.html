                            I've been delaying the writing of this review for a few weeks now, and I finally had the time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To begin, let me introduce myself. I'm byt3d1$t1ll3r, and I've worked as a penetration tester for several years. I currently hold some <i>advanced</i> certifications, such as OSCE3, and therefore I'm quite familiar with some of the techniques covered in the PMAT course, as well as some binary file analysis techniques. However, that doesn't make me a malware analyst, neither an expert on cybersecurity field.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also want to clarify that my intentions for enrolling in the PMAT program stemmed from the fact that I found it a very interesting field and thought at the time that it would be a great way to practice reverse engineering, see some of the techniques I use daily in a truly malicious context, and learn about other tools and methods of analysis.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The reason for writing this review is to share my experience with those interested in this course and certification, and to replicate the efforts of those who have written reviews in the past to contribute something to the community.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Well, I bought the certification package last November during the Black Friday promotions. I took advantage of the discount they offered on the individual package, and because of my job, I was able to start studying a week later.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To be honest, this isn't the first time I've encountered malware analysis techniques. Several years ago, at school, I took a short malware analysis workshop that lasted a few hours, we only covered basic static analysis and a very brief introduction to basic dynamic analysis, and to be honest, I barely understood anything. Like many, I've also watched some of John Hammond's analysis videos. I'm still amazed by his ability to explain several things, and I personally consider him an incredible divulger. I had also read the book <a href="https://nostarch.com/malware" class="social-link-il">Practical Malware Analysis</a>, which an old friend lended to me. And a couple of months before, I readed the articles in Alexandre Borges' <a href="https://exploitreversing.com/" class="social-link-il">Malware Analysis Series</a>. Both the book and the articles are beautiful material; the book provides very good introductory aspects (even though it was published years ago), and Alexandre Borges' articles are a delightful journey through robust and enriching malware analyses.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I must admit that I struggled to follow some of Alexandre's articles, so I had to read some sections two or three times. But once you understand what he describes and demonstrates, you appreciate the great value of the content in those articles.
                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            About the course
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            Okay, getting back to the course, overall: I LOVED IT! The instructor, Matt Kiely (Husky Hacks), did an excellent job. From my perspective, he structured the course content in a very engaging way. The level of difficulty increased gradually, and this course is a great option for those who want to get started in Malware Analysis field. However, if you want to better understand and domain the techniques Matt Kiely describes, I think the level of difficulty can be increased. I believe TCM mentions this perfectly on the exam page.
                        </p>

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <i>If you are a beginner, the exam will be very difficult and we strongly recommend that you purchase the associated training.</i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <i>If you are a junior malware researcher, the exam will be difficult and may require additional training.</i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <i>If you are a mid to senior-level malware analyst, researcher, or reverse engineer, the exam will be of moderate difficulty."</i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although they mention it for the exam, it also applies to the techniques covered in the course.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In my case, I was a web developer in the past, then a penetration tester, and I also have certifications like OSCE3, so I'm quite familiar with several topics and some of the analysis techniques (and those analyzed) covered in the course. However, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the course and learn new things.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I loved that you can set up your own lab during the course. If you're like me, you'll love having that independence to practice at your own pace.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also liked the way Matt describes his analyses in the videos. In my opinion, he did a very good job, and the quality is evident because he explains things very well.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the beginning of the course, I had some reservations about the samples that would be analyzed. I was a little nervous that I might not have set up my lab correctly (because my setup was over VMWare and not the recommended ones), but Matt dispelled all those doubts by explaining how to do it step by step, which let me to replicate steps on my own lab setup version. While there are techniques out there in the real world to escape the sandbox of a virtualization engine, the samples analyzed throughout the course are controlled, and many are harmless.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I've read some reviews suggesting that Matt could delve deeper into certain types of malware. However, considering that this is a non-advanced course, I think the types of malware covered are sufficient for the maximum level of the course.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The truth is, I took my time with the course, and even so, between work and various personal activities, I finished it in a couple of weeks (including the challenges Matt assigned) and also by replicating everything he showed in my lab.
                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            About the exam
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            I started my exam a couple of days before the end of the year, taking advantage of the fact that  inmmy job my workload was practically nonexistent during those days, so I could use them for the exam.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you do the math, I only had a few days to prepare for the exam. My serious preparation for the exam actually took place throughout the course. In the challenges Matt assigned, I was getting at least the same results as he showed (I was doing them before watching his walkthroughs). In some cases, I even noticed that in my own analysis I identified things that he sometimes overlooked (I think intentionally, to keep the course engaging). Also, after reading several online reviews that mentioned everything you need for the exam is in the course, and given how enjoyable the course was and that I felt my performance throughout the course wasn't too bad, I felt confident to taking the exam.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Naturally, I won't comment on the exam content, but for me, it was quite a very fun experience. I also really enjoyed the exam itself, although five whole days is a bit tiring, especially when you add the two extra days for writing and uploading the report.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I tried to follow the recommendations from other reviews that suggest taking a quick look at all the samples to get a rough idea of the effort required to analyze each one, analyzing the simpler ones first and leaving the more difficult/complex ones for last to give them the time they deserve.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I really appreciate those recommendations and tips, which, although some reviews are a bit old, are still relevant.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I confirmed firsthand that the course is indeed sufficient to prepare for the exam, BUT only if you truly understand Matt's explanations and, above all, if you're familiar with the tools he mentions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It's also true that the exam samples vary in difficulty and are diverse (don't expect them all to be of the same type).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The truth is, throughout the exam, I took time to eat, sleep well, and watch some TV series episodes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I finished analyzing all the samples in three and a half of the five days I had (both static and dynamic analysis, basic and advanced), I dedicated the fourth day's second half to gathering evidence for anything I was missing, and on the last day, I started writing the report.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Regarding the report, it took me three days to write a 163 page report.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It might seem like a long time to some, but it was my first malware analysis report (my mistake, I should have practiced writing malware analysis reports during the course).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Furthermore, my work requires me to dedicate a significant amount of time to writing reports. For me, it's crucial to include as much evidence as necessary to clarify any points, properly highlight relevant information in each image, describe each one, detail what was done and identified, and ensure the report's overall presentation is well-executed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For the report, I used the template included in the course materials, although I made some adjustments to the cover page to add my name and indicate that it was an exam report.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finally, I uploaded the report for review, and after nine business days, I received an email stating that the review of my report was complete and that I should log in to the platform to check my results.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although I don't work in malware analysis, I recommend this certification to anyone interested in learning the fundamentals of this type of analysis, and honestly, I learned and reinforced quite a lot.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Even as a penetration tester, I think it's quite valuable because it shows you another way to execute the techniques you've already known, and above all, it helps you understand some of the ways in which the techniques you use daily are detected.
                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            General recommendations for the course and the exam:
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            I think the course is very good on its own, and it's indeed more than enough to prepare for the exam. Of course, it's extremely important to know how to use the tools covered in the course (or equivalent ones) in order to take the exam.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, if you want to understand the course better and get more out of it, I recommend supplementing it with the book <a href="https://nostarch.com/malware" class="social-link-il">Practical Malware Analysis</a> from No Starch Press.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also believe that the analyses John Hammond describes in some of his videos can give you more ideas on techniques for extracting embedded malware.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And if, after the course and exam, you'd like to explore longer and more robust analyses, I highly recommend Alexandre Borges' <a href="https://exploitreversing.com/" class="social-link-il">Malware Analysis Series</a> articles.
                        </p>
